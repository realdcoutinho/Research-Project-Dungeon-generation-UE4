# Research-Project-Dungeon-generation-UE4

Introduction:
This research project focuses on developing a procedural dungeon generation system within the Unreal Engine 4 environment using C++. The primary objective is to create a dynamic process that generates diverse and randomized dungeons for gameplay.

Dungeon Creation:
The core element of dungeon creation is the C_Dungeon class. This class employs a UStaticMeshComponent named m_pStaticBox to represent rooms. During the class constructor's execution, the static mesh is initialized, taking the form of a mesh cube. However, essential attributes like location, dimensions, and visibility remain unset at this stage, leaving them for subsequent configuration.
An important consideration is that UE4 restricts the generation of static meshes during runtime. Consequently, all potential rooms must be pre-created at compile time, regardless of their eventual use. This process is executed within the C_Generate constructor, where dungeon instances are instantiated and subsequently added to the m_pDungeonArray.

Dungeon Configuration:
The SetDungeons() function in the C_Generate class manages dungeon configuration. It initiates by concealing (setting bHiddenInGame) all static meshes within the m_DungeonArray and emptying the cells in m_pGrid (details on this below).
To introduce an element of randomness into the dungeon generation, a random integer within the range of 0 to 1000 is obtained from RandRange. This integer acts as a seed for an FRandomStream. Given the cell dimensions in m_pGrid, the number of rows and columns, and the minimum position, maximum x and y positions are established for each dungeon.
With the foundational parameters set, the next step is to define dungeon attributes. By employing the previously mentioned FRandomStream alongside the specified minimum and maximum center positions, a genuinely random center point is computed. The same process is repeated for determining the dungeon's width and depth, utilizing the designated measurement ranges.
Once the random center is calculated, it is incorporated into the m_pGrid, which identifies the corresponding cell and returns both its center location and index. At this juncture, the system examines existing dungeons. A radius is established (maximum size of width and depth plus a margin). If another dungeon already occupies the space defined by the current dungeon's center and the calculated radius, the process restarts. Conversely, if the area is unoccupied, the cell is designated as filled, and the current dungeon's attributes (center, width, and depth) are finalized. Furthermore, the dungeon's visibility is activated.

Triangulation: 
Now, having established the static meshes for the dungeons with their visibility and parameters properly configured, the focus shifts towards the C_Graph component. Its initial objective revolves around the generation of a Delaunay Triangulation using the Bowyer-Watson Algorithm. Commencing this process involves the creation of a super triangle. Ensuring that the circumcircle engendered by this super triangle effectively encompasses all the center points of the dungeon locations is of paramount importance, necessitating a significantly larger size.

Subsequently, the compilation of all these dungeon center points ensues, and the C_Graph initiates the Triangulation procedure. Below, you will find a representation of the aforementioned algorithm in pseudo-code.

Mininmum Spanning Tree: 
The process of triangulation, while significant, proves insufficient to meet the objectives outlined in this project. Merely establishing edges through triangulation falls short of our intent to transform each edge into a functional pathway linking the dungeons. Our aspiration encompasses the creation of a comprehensive approach, enabling the identification of a minimum spanning path interconnecting all dungeons, characterized by the absence of redundant routes. To achieve this, we turn to an additional algorithm, namely the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm.

A Minimum Spanning Tree represents a subset of edges extracted from a connected, edge-weighted graph. This subset serves the purpose of interconnecting all vertices devoid of cycles, all the while maintaining the minimal aggregate edge weight possible. Essentially, this algorithm offers a method to determine the most resource-efficient means to establish connections among a given set of vertices.

However, prior to embarking on the coding phase for this algorithm, several preparatory measures are imperative. Foremost, a comprehensive inventory of edges to be employed within the Minimum Spanning Tree must be assembled.

Onto the node creation
We begin by clearing the nodesArray, which is a collection to hold nodes. Then, a map called nodesMap is created. This map will help organize nodes based on their positions. For each edge in the triangulationEdges, the code checks if nodes already exist for the start and end points of the edge in the nodesMap. If not, new nodes are created and initialized with the corresponding locations. Each edge is then connected to the appropriate nodes by adding the edge to their connection lists.
Unique nodes are extracted from the nodesMap and added to the nodesArray.
Moving on, a new array called allEdges is set up. For each node in the nodesArray, the code looks at the edges in its connections list. It identifies the corresponding end node by searching within the nodesArray. New edges are then formed using these start and end nodes, and these edges are added to the allEdges array.
After that, each node's _connections list is updated to contain all the edges from allEdges. Additionally, the Union-Find data structure is initialized for each node. This involves setting each node as its own parent and assigning a rank of 0.
This entire process effectively establishes connections between nodes through edges, while also preparing the data structure for subsequent operations.

Having successfully completed the Triangulation process, including the extraction and validation of edges, as well as the creation of nodes, we are now prepared to execute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. 
The provided pseudo-code for this operation is presented below:

On the Union helper function:
The function takes two pointers to FTriangulationNode objects, referred to as rootA and rootB, as parameters. These nodes represent the root elements of the sets that need to be merged. The core logic of the function revolves around comparing the ranks of these two root nodes. The rank is a measure of the depth or height of a node within its tree structure. It reflects the number of nodes in the longest path from the node to a leaf.

On FindRoot helper funtion:
It identifies and returns the root node in a union-find data structure. The loop checks if the current node's parent isn't itself, iteratively updates the node to its parent until the root is found, and then returns the root node's pointer.

To conclude the procedures within the C_Graph class, we invoke the Path() function. This is facilitated by utilizing the GetAllActorsOfClass() method to locate the C_Grid instance within the game world.

The C_Grid entity is responsible for path calculation between two given locations. To execute this, an iteration is performed over the edges present in the mstEdgesArray. During this iteration, the starting location of each edge is identified and subsequently passed as an argument to the AStarPath() function within the C_Grid class.

Should there arise any inquiries regarding the specific data types and structures employed throughout these processes, comprehensive information can be referenced in the DataTypes.h file situated under the directory path Source > DungeonGeneration > DataTypes.h. This file encapsulates the fundamental definitions utilized in the context of this intricate procedure.


Grid Creation:
Before delving into the intricacies of the AStartPath() function that the C_Graph has passed to us, it is prudent to provide a brief overview of the class itselfâ€”its inception, purpose, and functionalities.

As discerned from our prior discussions, the C_Grid class serves two pivotal roles: the first involves the establishment of the grid structure, delineating the placement of dungeons and meticulously managing their availability. The second pertains to the critical function of navigating paths between locations, a responsibility it undertakes through interactions with C_Graph.

As alluded to earlier, the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) framework imposes constraints on the generation of static meshes during runtime. Correspondingly, the generation of potential path and corridor blocks necessitates pre-creation during compile time, regardless of their subsequent utilization. This integral process transpires within the CreateCell() function, which is invoked within the C_Grid constructor. It's worth noting that the C_Grid class abstains from a conventional TArray of UStaticMeshComponent pointers. Instead, it adopts a more efficient approach via the definition of an FCell structure. This structure holistically addresses impending challenges by encapsulating attributes such as index, center, position, state, and notably, the static mesh component itself. The culmination of this endeavor results in the incorporation of the newly created FCell into an array named TArray<FCell>, which subsequently transitions us into configuring its connections through the CreateConnections() function.

Navigating through each FCell within the array involves leveraging the functions GetColumnIndex() and GetRowIndex() to extract the column and row values, respectively, for the current cell under consideration. A distinct TArray<FVector> facilitates the representation of possible 2D directions in which each cell can be interconnected. Upon meticulous computations, the outcome materializes in the form of a fresh FGridConnection, seamlessly woven into the connections TArray<FGridConnection> intrinsic to the cell.

With those preliminary matters addressed, we can seamlessly resume our progression from the point where we pausedâ€”specifically, at the juncture of the AStarPath() function. The subsequent pseudo-code is delineated below:

Conclusion: 
This project has unfolded as a journey dedicated to crafting a procedural dungeon generation system within the confines of Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), leveraging the power of C++ as the driving force. Beyond the project's inherent technical challenges, it has provided me with a profound learning opportunity to enhance my skills as a programmer, particularly as a UE4 developer.
The project's primary aim was to create an innovative and dynamic process that engenders a diverse array of randomized dungeons, enriching gameplay experiences. Various critical aspects of dungeon generation have been addressed. The creation of dungeons was meticulously managed by the C_Dungeon class, carefully configuring room representations using UStaticMeshComponent elements. The generation process, while constrained by UE4's restrictions on dynamic mesh generation, was efficiently handled through pre-creation during compile time. The concept of Triangulation was employed to establish interconnections between dungeons, laying the foundation for the subsequent Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm.
